Description: MiMIR (Metabolomics-based Models for Imputing Risk), is a unique graphical user interface that provides an intuitive framework for ad-hoc statistical analysis of 1H-NMR metabolomics by Nightingale Health. It allows to easily explore new metabolomics measurements assayed by Nightingale Health, comparing the distributions with a large Consortium (BBMRI-nl); project previously published metabolic scores; and calibrate the metabolic surrogate values to a desired dataset.
