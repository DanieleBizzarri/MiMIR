\usage{
subset_metabolites_overlap(x, metabos, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric data-frame with Nightingale-metabolomics}

\item{metabos}{vector of strings containing the names of the metabolic features to be selected}

\item{quiet}{logical to suppress the messages in the console}
}
\value{
matrix with the selected Nightingale-metabolomics features
}
\description{
Helper function that subsets the NH-metabolomics matrix features to the selection in metabolites needed for the metabolic score
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(MiMIR)

#load the Nightignale metabolomics dataset
metabolic_measures <- read.csv("Nightingale_file_path",header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
#Select the metabolic features
mat <- subset_metabolites_overlap(x=metabolic_measures,metabos=PARAM_metaboAge$MET)
