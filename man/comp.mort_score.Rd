\description{
Function to compute the mortality score made by Deelen et al. on Nightingale metabolomics data-set.
}
\details{
This multivariate model predicts all-cause mortality at 5 or 10 years better than clinical variables normally associated with mortality.
It is constituted of 14 metabolic features quantified by Nightingale Health.
It was originally trained using a stepwise Cox regression analysis in a meta-analysis on 12 cohorts composed by 44,168 individuals.
}
\examples{
library(MiMIR)

#load the Nightignale metabolomics dataset
metabolic_measures <- synthetic_metabolic_dataset
#Prepare the metabolic features fo the mortality score
mortScore<-comp.mort_score(metabolic_measures,quiet=TRUE)
