\title{impute.miss}
\usage{
impute.miss(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric data-frame with Nightingale-metabolomics}
}
\value{
matrix of the Nightingale-metabolomics dataset with missing values imputed to zero
}
\description{
Helper function that subsets the NH-metabolomics matrix to the samples with less than Nmax zeros
}
\details{
Function created that subsets the NH-metabolomics matrix samples to the ones for which the metabolites
included in MetaboAge for which the log of the metabolic concentrations are not more than 5SD away from their mean
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(MiMIR)

#load the Nightignale metabolomics dataset
metabolic_measures <- read.csv("Nightingale_file_path",header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
#Imputing missing values
mat <- impute.miss(metabolic_measures)
}
